# Iteration 2 Report (Steps 1–8)

> Dataset: BRFSS 2015 Diabetes Health Indicators

## Step 3 – Data Preparation
- Selection:
- Cleaning (outliers/missing/types):
- Construction (derived fields):
- Integration:
- Reformatting:

## Step 4 – Transformation
- Reduction (feature selection):
- Projection (transformations/normalisation):

## Step 5 – Match DM Methods to Objectives
(Why classification, interpretability vs performance)

## Step 6 – Algorithm Selection
(Chosen algorithms & justification)

## Step 7 – Data Mining
- Test design (split/k-fold, rationale):
- Balancing approach:
- Model runs & outputs (confusion matrices, ROC/Gains):
- Screenshots exported to `figures/`

## Step 8 – Results & Interpretation
- Patterns & variable importance:
- Visualisations:
- Interpretation (public-health meaning):
- Evaluation (metrics, overfitting):
- Multiple iterations summary (link to `docs/iterations.md`)
